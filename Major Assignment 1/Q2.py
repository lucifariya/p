# Create a function tax_amount that shows how much taxes are deducted from the basic salary. Taxes are applied as follows:
# • If the salary is less than Rs. 60,000/-, deduct 10% as tax.
# • If the salary is between Rs. 60,000/- and Rs. 85,000/-, deduct 15% as tax.
# • If the salary is more than Rs. 85,000/-, deduct 20% as tax.
